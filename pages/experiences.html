        <h1>Undergrad Research Assistant</h1>
        <h2>University of Tennessee Knoxville (UTK)</h2>
        <h3>Spring 2021 - Present</h3>
        <p>
          Conceptualizing, designing, and coding a block-based coding literacy maze tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tool generates mazes based on stories' plots for students to traverse using code. With this, 
          students advance not only their literary sequencing and comprehension abilities, but also their 
          computer science skills in a challenging, yet fun way. Customizability is implemented as much as possible 
          to adhere by teachers' specific needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tool allows K-5 teachers, whose schools may not have dedicated computer science programs, 
          to integrate computer science into their pre-existing curriculum, specifically in their ELA courses.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h1>Full Stack Developer Intern</h1>
        <h2>Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)</h2>
        <h3>Summer 2019</h3>
        <p>
          Developed the <a href="https://nhts.ornl.gov/" target="_blank">National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) web application</a>
          funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration.
          The NHTS web application takes data collected from the National Household
          Travel Survey and creates visual representations (e.g. graphs, diagrams,
          tables) of that data for federal and state agencies, researchers, and
          other consumers to find trends in travel and improve the infrastructure
          in their areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mentors were <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/ross-wang" target="_blank">Dr. Ross Wang</a>, 
          an R&D Staff Member in the Transportation Analytics & Decision Sciences Group 
          at ORNL, and <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/gina-k-accawi">Gina Accawi</a>, 
          a Technical Senior Staff Member at ORNL specializing in energy consumption analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked to resolve issues/bugs, utilizing team management
          tools like GitLab, and conceptualized, designed, and coded several key
          features, including a custom variables system that improved the UX by
          allowing users to have more query results tailored to their needs. Through
          this internship, I learned AngularJS and C#, and refined my previous Bootstrap
          experience.

        <h1>FIRST Robotics Competition</h1>
        <h2>FRC 3824: HVA RoHAWKtics</h2>
        <h3>Fall 2016 - Present</h3>
        <p>
          The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics
          competition where teams create an industry-sized robot from scratch in 
          six weeks within a restricted budget to play an annually created 3-on-3 robot game. 
          The HVA RoHAWKtics is Hardin Valley Academy's robotics team where I served in several 
          leadership positions and now volunteer as a mentor.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Mentor (2020-Present), I teach high school students about programming and 
          electronics. I help students overcome issues and challenges in projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Executive Captain (2019-2020), I managed a team of over forty-five students and adult
          mentors. I organized and led team meetings, ensured subteams were working efficiently, 
          and determined the team's next steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Programming Captain (2017-2020), I led the programming of the robot and taught 
          underclassmen how to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the prestigious honor of being Robot Driver (2018-2020),
          I controlled our robot's movement during competitive matches while collaborating
          with our alliance partners (other teams on my team's side).

        <h1>CodeTN Competition</h1>
        <h2>Hardin Valley Academy</h2>
        <h3>Fall 2016 - Spring 2019</h3>
        <p>
          CodeTN was a coding competition where students were tasked to create
          a web application that solves a school or community problem. My teams
          created two award-winning web applications, "plan it" and "Rcar."
        </p>
        <p>
          plan it was a job shift scheduler built for companies and volunteering
          organizations looking to assign times as well as specific job tasks to individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="projects.html?section=rCar" target="_blank">Rcar</a> was a ride-sharing
          service that allowed those going to the same places to connect and carpool
          ultimately creating a greater community and helping the environment by
          reducing car exhaust pollution.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Team Captain (2018-2019), I organized each person's role on the team and led
          the design process.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Front-End Lead (2016-2019), I distributed the various tasks
          required to develop the front-end portion of our web application to my
          teammates and made sure those tasks were being completed with great quality
          and within a certain amount of time.
