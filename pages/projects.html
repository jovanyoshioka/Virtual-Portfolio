        <h1>Drone Fleet</h1>
        <h2>Python, OpenCV, OpenPose</h2>
        <h3>Summer 2020 - Present</h3>
        <p>
          The Drone Fleet project is a long-term project I intend to work on throughout
          college. The ultimate goal of this project is for self-development in programming
          physical machines. I currently envision three different phases: Premade,
          Build, and Connect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently in the Premade phase, learning and coding premade drones called
          Tello EDUs sold by DJI, a technology company that sells "aerial photography
          systems." I will utilize the swarm functionality and programmability in order
          to create a fleet that can follow me around and individually perform commands
          based on my body gestures using OpenCV and OpenPose coded in Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Build phase will consist of me attempting to construct, program, and fly
          my own drones. I will use electronics like gyroscopes and accelerometers, and
          program with PIDs in order to have steady flight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Connect phase will be when I apply my vision processing and command
          programming from the Premade phase to my personally built drones.

        <h1>Virtual Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</h2>
        <h3>Summer 2020</h3>
        <p>
          Wanting to compile my projects, experiences, and awards in one place, and
          desiring to add my own touch, I decided to conceptualize, design, code,
          and publish my very own virtual portfolio website. What you are browsing
          right now is the product of that decision; I hope you like it.
        </p>
        <p>
           Not only was this a fun project to work on, but it served as a great learning
          and development opportunity for me during the extended break from school
          I received due to COVID-19. By coding this completely from scratch, and without
          the help of coding frameworks or libraries, I greatly improved my HTML, CSS, and
          especially JavaScript skills. I branched out of my comfort zone
          and tried coding a JavaScript canvas animation for the first time,
          and I am pleased with the outcome, both with the physical product and the knowledge
          I have gained. I also improved my coding skills in general, commenting more often,
          making better use of whitespace, and focusing on code-reusability and modularity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, please feel free to
          <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">reach out to me</a>; I would love to hear from you.

        <h1>AlienX Robot Code</h1>
        <h2>Java, WPILib</h2>
        <h3>Spring 2020</h3>
        <p>
          AlienX was my team's robot for the FIRST Robotics Competition 2020 game,
          Infinite Recharge. Watch the game animation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmiYWTmFRVE" target="_blank">here</a>.
          The objective of the game was to launch yellow balls, into a goal, climb
          onto a teetering bar, and spin a color wheel. As Robot Driver, I controlled
          AlienX's movement on the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          AlienX required sophisticated control systems. PIDs (controlling
          output to meet a certain setpoint) were used to control the powercell launcher
          wheels' RPMs. Vision processing (tracking reflective tape) was used to
          aim towards the goal. Spline trajectories were implemented for smoother
          movement during the autonomous period of the game. A sonar sensor (measures
          distance through sound waves) algorithm was made to automatically index
          the powercells in the chamber. RGB LEDs were coded to turn either red,
          blue, or purple signifying if the robot was correctly connected to the
          field. Additionally, the LEDs would toggle between red and green when
          launching to signify if all control systems were ready for launch (launcher
          wheels were up to speed, angle of launcher was at its setpoint, and chassis
          was turned towards the goal by vision processing).

        <h1>Minecraft Assassin Plugin</h1>
        <h2>Java, Spigot API</h2>
        <h3>Spring 2020</h3>
        <p>
          In early 2020, FIRST, an organization that hosts several
          robotics competitions, had officially suspended all
          competitions due to COVID-19. This left my team and myself devastated
          after all of our hard work had been ruined.
        </p>
        <p>
          With no school, and therefore no homework, and many businesses closing,
          leaving many jobless, my team needed a way to stay connected and keep
          ourselves occupied. With this, we decided to start our own team Minecraft
          multiplayer server. Minecraft is a sandbox video game where you can explore,
          gather resources, build, and fight monsters and other players.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the server more enjoyable for those who got bored of standard Minecraft,
          I decided to create a plugin that allowed people to place public bounties and hire assassins
          to take out specific targets for in-game monetary rewards. This added
          a thrilling factor to the game for when someone hired an assassin, it
          would simply announce to everyone "A new assassination contract has been
          activated! Watch out." without disclosing who the target was. The paranoia
          created a new level of excitement for everyone keeping our server alive.

        <h1>Path Following Code</h1>
        <h2>Java, WPILib, Pathfinder</h2>
        <h3>Winter 2019</h3>
        <p>
          In order to be better prepared for the upcoming robotics season, I took
          the initiative of bringing a team robot home with me over winter break
          and programmed it in my garage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objective was to integrate autonomous path following where one can
          draw trajectories on a map of the field and have the robot automatically
          follow that path based on auto-generated kinematic values. These values would consist
          of an x and y position relative to the bottom left of the field map,
          position, instantaneous velocity, and instantaneous acceleration values of the robot,
          and heading in radians. To ensure the robot was consistent with these values,
          encoders were mounted on the wheels of the robot to measure
          the number of wheel revolutions and therefore be able to tell its position,
          velocity, or acceleration. A gyro was also used to determine the robot's
          heading.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was successful in implementing autonomous path following, and was able
          to essentially program a set of commands that would place two game pieces
          in the goals where most teams' robots could only place one.

          E-ssue was a web application designed to manage the issuance of E-books
          to students. E-ssue's main feature was its ability to create different class pages
          for instructors to add students to, create a list of E-books, and assign
          those E-books to the added students. In addition, users can track students'
          class grades, view weekly reports of all E-books assigned, interact with
          E-BOT, E-ssue's custom-made artificial intelligence Q&A bot, and view a
          thirteen page user manual. There are also two different user interfaces
          to choose from to improve the user experience: tables and modals, and
          drag and drop.
        </p>
        <p>
          This web application was created for the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA)
          Coding and Programming Competitive Event. I ended up receiving first place
          in the state of Tennessee and first place in the nation as well. I designed,
          coded, and tested the state competition version in three days and added a
          week worth of additions for the national competition version.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the first web application I created both the front end and back end
          solely by myself from scratch without any code frameworks or libraries.

        <h3>Spring 2019</h3>
        <p>
          Rcar was a web application that served as a ride-sharing service that
          allowed those going to the same destination or event to connect with each
          other, socialize, and carpool. Rcar's main feature was its group chat
          functionality where individuals looking to carpool could get to know
          each other and coordinate what time and place to be picked up at. I created
          a custom-built emoticons system that would allow users to select facial
          expressions, and a color, to send to the group chat. In order to achieve
          this, I developed an algorithm that would encode the selected emoticon,
          send that encoded emoticon to the database, and when retrieved, parse
          the emoticon. Other features of Rcar included a list of nearby events,
          a list of individuals going to nearby events that a user could possibly
          connect with, and a contacts list.
        </p>
        <p>
          By promoting socializing and carpooling, Rcar would ultimately
          create a more closely bonded community and would help the environment by
          reducing car exhaust pollution.
        </p>
        <p>
          This web application was created by myself and three other individuals
          for the <a href="experiences.html?section=codeTN" target="_blank">CodeTN Competition</a>
          and won second place.
